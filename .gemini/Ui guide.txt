Most common patterns you’ll copy-paste forever:

hidden md:block          → hide on mobile, show on desktop
block md:hidden          → show on mobile, hide on desktop
flex-col md:flex-row     → stack on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
text-2xl md:text-4xl     → bigger text on desktop
p-4 md:p-8               → more padding on bigger screens
grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3   → responsive grid

Container rule (use this on every page):

<div className="container mx-auto px-4 lg:px-8">
→ automatically gives perfect horizontal padding + max-width.

Never guess — just check in devtools:

Press F12 → click the phone/tablet icon → drag the screen width → you instantly see which breakpoint is active
